This is a project I am creating as a way for me to study Graphql using express, node.js, mongodb, javascript, and react. 

The purpose of this application is to make a MERN stack using Graphql. Book-tracker was originally created by NetNinja. However, that project uses many tools that are depricated so I am trying to update the project and create my own at the same time. 

A few things that need to be updated from the original tutorial are certain npm packages. One is express-graphql. This is depricated. GraphqlHTTP is the newest npm package, which allows for the creation of an Express server that runs GraphQL. 

Another Depreication is Mlabs. I will now have to use MondoDB Atlas as the database.
