This is a project I am creating as a way for me to study Graphql using express, node.js, mongodb, javascript, and react. 

The purpose of this application is to make a MERN stack using Graphql. Book-tracker was originally created by NetNinja. However, that project uses many tools that are depricated so I am trying to update the project and create my own at the same time. 

A few things that need to be updated from the original tutorial are certain npm packages. One is express-graphql. This is depricated. GraphqlHTTP is the newest npm package, which allows for the creation of an Express server that runs GraphQL. 
However, there are other servers like Apollo, which use Node and GraphQL. It is open source and compatible with any Graphql client, including Apollo Client and React. 

Another Depreication is Mlabs. I will now have to use MondoDB Atlas as the database.
