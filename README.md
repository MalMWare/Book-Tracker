This is a project I am creating as a way for me to study Graphql and Apollo using express, node.js, mongodb, javascript, and react. 

The purpose of this application is to make a MERN stack using Graphql. Book-tracker was originally a tutorial created by NetNinja. However, that project uses many tools that are depricated so I am trying to update the project and create my own at the same time. I am also using a tutorial by Traversy Media. In it he uses Apollo and MongoDB Atlas. I will be using MongoDB Atlas for the database.
